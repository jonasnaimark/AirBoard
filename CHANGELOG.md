- **Made organizeImportedFolder() Unconditional**: Now calls folder organization AFTER import blocks, not inside them
- **Handles Pre-existing Templates**: Organizes folder even when templates already exist (no import needed)
- **Idempotent & Safe**: Function only moves folder if found in root, safe to call multiple times

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Moved `organizeImportedFolder()` outside the `if (!gestureComp)` and `if (!componentComp)` blocks
- Now runs regardless of whether import happened or templates already existed
- Covers cases where templates were imported previously but folder never got organized

- **Universal Import Organization**: Added folder organization to ALL import locations (Device, Gesture, Component)
- **Reusable Function**: Created `organizeImportedFolder()` function used consistently across all imports

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Root-level items in After Effects have `parentFolder === null`, not `app.project`
- This was preventing the "AirBoard Templates.aep" folder from being detected and moved
- Now calls `organizeImportedFolder()` after every `app.project.importFile()` call
- Should finally work correctly for folder organization
- Associated with AirBoard_v2.9.6.zxp

## [2.9.5] - 2025-08-15

- Removed all complex detection patterns and timing issues
- Associated with AirBoard_v2.9.5.zxp

## [2.9.4] - 2025-08-15
### 🔧 Fixed
