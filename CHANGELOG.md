## [2.1.9] - 2025-08-14
### 🎨 Improved
- Enhanced button hover animations with smooth 0.2s fade transitions
- Replaced gradient backgrounds with solid colors for smoother animations
- Added subtle white border (6% opacity) to button containers
- Improved drop shadow positioning for better depth perception

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Updated all CSS transitions to use cubic-bezier easing
- Optimized button styling for consistent hover feedback
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with refined shadow offsets

## [2.1.2] - 2024-08-14
### Added
- ( **Playhead positioning**: Gesture layers now start at current playhead position
- <� Enhanced workflow: Move playhead to desired frame, click "Add Gesture", layer appears exactly there
- =� Comprehensive documentation of playhead positioning implementation

### Fixed
- =' Template file updates in AirBoard Templates.aep
- = Integration with existing scaling solution from v2.0.5

### Technical Details
- Uses After Effects `startTime` property for precise positioning
- Preserves all existing functionality (scaling, centering, layer targeting)
- Non-breaking addition to proven layer targeting system

## [2.1.0] - 2024-08-14
### Added
- <� Initial playhead positioning feature for gesture layers

-  Unlimited gesture additions in any order
-  Eliminated false "unexpected name" errors

### Technical Details
- **KEY SOLUTION**: Clear selections � copyToComp() � target index 1 directly
- Removed problematic name validation that caused false errors
- Bulletproof layer targeting using After Effects guaranteed behavior
- **Reusable scaling logic** ready for future features
