## [2.1.2] - 2024-08-14
### Added
- ( **Playhead positioning**: Gesture layers now start at current playhead position
- <¯ Enhanced workflow: Move playhead to desired frame, click "Add Gesture", layer appears exactly there
- =Ú Comprehensive documentation of playhead positioning implementation

### Fixed
- =' Template file updates in AirBoard Templates.aep
- = Integration with existing scaling solution from v2.0.5

### Technical Details
- Uses After Effects `startTime` property for precise positioning
- Preserves all existing functionality (scaling, centering, layer targeting)
- Non-breaking addition to proven layer targeting system

## [2.1.0] - 2024-08-14
### Added
- <¯ Initial playhead positioning feature for gesture layers
- =Í Layer start time matches current comp.time position

## [2.0.5] - 2024-08-14 <Æ **SCALING SOLUTION**
### Fixed
- <¯ **MAJOR**: Gesture layer scaling now works correctly regardless of quantity added
-  Resolution-based scaling: 2x=100%, 3x=150%, 4x=200%, 5x=250%, 6x=300%
-  Unlimited gesture additions in any order
-  Eliminated false "unexpected name" errors

### Technical Details
- **KEY SOLUTION**: Clear selections ’ copyToComp() ’ target index 1 directly
- Removed problematic name validation that caused false errors
- Bulletproof layer targeting using After Effects guaranteed behavior
- **Reusable scaling logic** ready for future features
